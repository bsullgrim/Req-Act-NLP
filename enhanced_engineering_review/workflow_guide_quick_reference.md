# Enhanced Dependency Analysis - Quick Reference Guide

## Quality Grades:
- **EXCELLENT (80+)**: Ready for matching and approval
- **GOOD (65-79)**: Minor issues, safe to proceed  
- **FAIR (50-64)**: Some improvements recommended
- **POOR (35-49)**: Significant issues, review carefully
- **CRITICAL (<35)**: Rewrite required before approval

## Quality-Enhanced Decision Guidelines:

### Approve if:
- Good match score + GOOD/EXCELLENT quality
- Multiple shared terms + well-written requirement
- Strong semantic similarity + no critical quality issues

### Review Further if:
- Good match + FAIR quality (may improve with enhancement)
- Mixed scoring signals + moderate quality issues
- Moderate similarity + vocabulary mismatch vs quality issue

### Reject/Rewrite if:
- CRITICAL quality grade (regardless of match score)
- POOR quality + low match (quality-caused mismatch)
- No shared terms + significant quality issues

## Quality Impact on Matching:
- **High Quality + Poor Match**: Algorithm/vocabulary limitation
- **Poor Quality + Poor Match**: Requirement needs rewriting
- **Poor Quality + Good Match**: Investigate for false positive
- **High Quality + Good Match**: High confidence approval

## File Descriptions:
- **Excel Workbook**: Main review interface with all data and explanations
- **HTML Report**: Visual summary with filtering capabilities
- **JSON Data**: Machine-readable format for integration
- **Action Items CSV**: Project management tracking
- **Summary Dashboard**: Analytics and metrics
