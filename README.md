## How It Works

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
   * Requirements and activities loaded from CSV files with automatic encoding detection
   * Text preprocessing: lemmatization, stopword removal, phrase normalization
   * Quality analysis: each requirement analyzed for structural and linguistic issues

2. **Domain Knowledge Extraction**
   * Auto-detection of technical terms using frequency analysis and linguistic patterns
   * Domain-specific weighting based on term characteristics (length, frequency, technical indicators)
   * Synonym expansion using pre-built dictionaries and semantic similarity

3. **Multi-Modal Similarity Computation**
   For each requirement-activity pair, five similarity scores are computed:

   * **Dense Semantic (Weight: 0.4)**: Transformer-based meaning similarity
   * **BM25 Lexical (Weight: 0.2)**: Statistical relevance ranking with term saturation
   * **Syntactic (Weight: 0.2)**: Structural similarity using dependency patterns
   * **Domain Weighted (Weight: 0.1)**: Emphasis on technical term overlap
   * **Query Expansion (Weight: 0.1)**: Semantic neighbor matching

4. **Quality-Enhanced Scoring**
   * Requirement quality scores influence match confidence
   * Poor quality requirements flagged for improvement
   * Quality-match correlation analysis provided

5. **Explainable Results Generation**
   * Detailed explanations for each similarity component
   * Quality impact analysis for poor matches
   * Evidence presentation (shared terms, similarity levels)

6. **Engineering Workflow Integration**
   * Results categorized by review priority and confidence
   * Excel workbooks with embedded explanations
   * HTML reports with interactive filtering
   * Action items for project management

## Requirements Quality Analysis

### Quality Dimensions Explained

#### **Clarity Score (0-100)**
Measures how clear and unambiguous the requirement is.

**❌ Poor Clarity (Score: ~30)**
> "The system should provide appropriate response times for users."

**✅ Good Clarity (Score: ~90)**  
> "The system shall display the user login screen within 2 seconds of startup."

**What Hurts Clarity:**
* Vague words: "appropriate," "adequate," "sufficient," "reasonable"
* Passive voice: "Data will be processed" vs "The system shall process data"
* Complex, hard-to-read sentences

#### **Completeness Score (0-100)**
Checks if the requirement has all necessary components.

**❌ Incomplete (Score: ~40)**
> "Send notifications when needed."
> * Missing: who, what kind, when exactly

**✅ Complete (Score: ~95)**
> "The system shall send an email notification to the user within 5 minutes when their order is confirmed."
> * **Who**: The system
> * **What**: send email notification
> * **To whom**: the user  
> * **When**: within 5 minutes
> * **Trigger**: when order is confirmed
> * **Strength**: "shall" (mandatory)

#### **Verifiability Score (0-100)**
Measures whether you can test if the requirement has been met.

**❌ Not Verifiable (Score: ~20)**
> "The system shall have good performance."

**✅ Verifiable (Score: ~100)**
> "The database shall support at least 1000 concurrent users with response times under 3 seconds."

**What Makes Requirements Verifiable:**
* Specific numbers: "within 2 seconds," "at least 100 users," "99.9% uptime"
* Measurable criteria: percentages, time limits, quantities
* Clear success conditions

#### **Atomicity Score (0-100)**
Checks if the requirement describes only one thing.

**❌ Multiple Requirements (Score: ~40)**
> "The system shall validate user passwords, send confirmation emails, and log all login attempts while maintaining security standards."

**✅ Atomic (Score: ~100)**
> "The system shall validate user passwords during login."

#### **Consistency Score (0-100)**
Measures use of standard requirement language.

**Modal Verb Meanings:**
* **shall/must/will**: Mandatory (required)
* **should**: Recommended (preferred but not required)  
* **may/can/might**: Optional (allowed but not required)

### Quality Score Interpretation

| Score Range | Grade | Meaning | Action Required |
|-------------|-------|---------|-----------------|
| **90-100** | EXCELLENT | Ready for implementation | No action needed |
| **80-89** | GOOD | Minor improvements beneficial | Optional cleanup |
| **70-79** | FAIR | Acceptable with some issues | Recommended fixes |
| **60-69** | POOR | Significant problems | Required improvements |
| **<60** | CRITICAL | Major rewrite needed | Must fix before use |

### Issue Severity Levels

#### **Critical Issues** 🚨
Fundamental problems making requirements unusable
* **Example**: Empty requirements, completely missing structure
* **Action**: Must fix immediately

#### **High Issues** ⚠️  
Significant problems affecting implementation or testing
* **Examples**: "adequate security" (not testable), missing essential components
* **Action**: Fix before development begins

#### **Medium Issues** ⚡
Moderate problems causing potential confusion
* **Examples**: Vague timing, unclear requirement strength, passive voice
* **Action**: Fix when possible, prioritize high-impact

#### **Low Issues** ℹ️
Minor style or clarity improvements
* **Examples**: Very long requirements, minor readability issues
* **Action**: Fix during reviews or updates

## Sample Output Examples

### High-Quality Match Example
```csv
ID,Requirement Text,Activity Name,Combined Score,Dense Semantic,BM25 Score,Syntactic Score,Domain Weighted,Query Expansion
REQ-001,"The system shall authenticate users within 2 seconds using multi-factor authentication",implement user authentication module,0.842,0.89,0.61,0.75,0.58,0.25
```

**Explanation:**
* **High semantic similarity (0.89)**: Strong conceptual alignment between "authenticate users" and "authentication module"
* **Good BM25 score (0.61)**: Shared terms like "authenticate," "users," "multi-factor"
* **Strong overall confidence**: Combined score of 0.842 indicates high-quality match

### Quality Analysis Example

**Original Requirement (Poor Quality - Score: 35)**
> "The system should provide adequate security and good performance while ensuring users have appropriate access to necessary functions as needed."

**Quality Issues Identified:**
* Clarity (high): ambiguous terms 'adequate', 'good', 'appropriate', 'necessary', 'as needed'
* Verifiability (high): no measurable criteria found
* Atomicity (high): multiple conjunctions suggest compound requirements
* Completeness (medium): weak modal verb 'should' vs required 'shall'

**Improved Requirements (Quality Score: ~90 each)**
1. "The system shall encrypt all user data using AES-256 encryption."
2. "The system shall respond to user requests within 2 seconds under normal load."
3. "The system shall authenticate users using multi-factor authentication before granting access to personal data."

## Troubleshooting

### Common Installation Issues

```bash
# spaCy model not found
python -m spacy download en_core_web_trf

# Encoding errors when reading CSV
# Solution: Tool automatically detects and handles multiple encodings

# Memory issues with large datasets
# Solution: Adjust batch_size parameter in nlp.pipe() calls
```

### Common Data Issues

#### File Format Problems
```bash
# Column not found error
python reqGrading.py -c "Your_Actual_Column_Name"

# Empty or malformed CSV
# Ensure CSV has proper headers and content
```

#### Quality Analysis Issues
* **All scores are low**: Check if requirements contain actual requirement text vs IDs
* **No domain terms found**: Verify requirements contain technical vocabulary
* **Encoding problems**: Tool handles multiple encodings automatically

#### Matching Performance Issues
* **Poor semantic scores**: Ensure transformer model is properly installed
* **No BM25 matches**: Check for shared vocabulary between requirements and activities
* **Low domain scores**: May indicate vocabulary mismatch requiring synonym expansion

### Performance Optimization

```python
# For large datasets (>1000 requirements)
matcher.run_final_matching(
    batch_size=16,  # Reduce for memory constraints
    min_sim=0.4,    # Higher threshold reduces computation
    top_n=3         # Fewer results per requirement
)
```
